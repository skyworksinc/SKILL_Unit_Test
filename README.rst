SKILL Unit Test
===============

A unit testing framework for the Cadence SKILL language.

Based on a `Cadence blog post series <https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/cic/posts/skill-for-the-skilled-simple-testing-macros>`_
https://github.com/skyworksinc/skill-unit-test/blob/master/README.rst
`SKILL_Tools qtest <https://github.com/MatthewLoveQUB/SKILL_Tools>`_ is an alternative test framework.  However it is written using lisp rather than C function call syntax.
